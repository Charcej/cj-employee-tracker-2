This is the first version I was able to put together. 1.0.0

## Test Instructions
No tests employed

## Future Development

In another version I would add a column for manager that everyone reports to. I would also include some of the bonus options like updating manager, vew employee by manager, view employee by department, delete department, roles and employees, the ability to view total utilized budget of a department, and maybe even a front end to make it more user friendly.
